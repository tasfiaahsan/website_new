I’m a PhD studnet in York University’s [Brain Behaviour and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/psychology/areas-of-specialization/brain-behaviour-and-cognitive-sciences/) program in the Department of Psychology. I’m interested in human vision, particularly how people perceive things in depth. I’m also very passionate about teaching, and creating free, accessible material to share online.
